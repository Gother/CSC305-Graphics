# CSc 305 - Graphics Theory

My assignments for csc 305

Assignment 1
=============

Rendering geometries to the viewport; geometry manipulations (transformations,
scaling) done manually.



Assignment 2
=============

Working with the camera: orthographic and projection views, rotating the world
in an arc-ball (spherical) movement, as well as a world-crawler movement. 
Geometry manipulations handled with matrices and vectors, placed into a model
matrix and passed into the shader.

Assignment 3
--------------

Assignment 3 implements basic shader techniques in illuminating objects in 
space. This includes Ambience, Diffuse and Specular (ADS) illumination; 
texture and bump mapping; and gouraud vs. phong models.

Assignment 4
--------------

Assignment 4 is a simple ray-tracer with collision detection for spheres and
axis-aligned planes. The ray-tracer allows for reflection and refraction, 
with a variable number of rays that can be cast. The program includes a simple
scene parser for building and selecting your own scenes.

# CSc 305 - Graphics Theory

My assignments for csc 305

Assignment 1
=============

Rendering geometries to the viewport; geometry manipulations (transformations,
scaling) done manually.



Assignment 2
=============

Working with the camera: orthographic and projection views, rotating the world
in an arc-ball (spherical) movement, as well as a world-crawler movement. 
Geometry manipulations handled with matrices and vectors, placed into a model
matrix and passed into the shader.
